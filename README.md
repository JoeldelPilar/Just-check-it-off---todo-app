Hi, welcome to "Just check it off". This is a simple "ToDo" - web app. This was the second assignment that was given to me during the course "JavaScript - Basics". I got the assignment about 4 weeks in to the course (8 weeks in total). 

I challenged myself to create it with TypeScript and Tailwind, both wich I was total new to. In my main.ts file I have tried to write self-explanatory code and in some places I've left comments to clarify functions, variables and so on. 

## Functionallity

Other than the classic "ToDo" functions, we had several conditionals that was required:

- Set deadline.
- Add category or some visual element.
- Passed deadline visual indication.
- Due in 5 days or less visual indication.
- ToDo done, visual change and auto sort last in list.

I also added some features that was out of scoope for the task but that I whanted to explore. In the left corner of the list is todays date displayed, quiet simple but had not tried using it before. Also I whanted to try using some kind of API and there for, in the right corner (bottom corner) is a week number display. This is fetched via a API. I noticed that sometimes the fetching does not get through, this does not affect the user, nor does it break the site. If you can't see the week number simply try and refresh the page.
